                    Hi friends! I am M V K SAI RAM and at present working in VIRTUSA CORPORATE COMPANY as an Associate Engineer.
                    I've completed my B.Tech from Maharaj Vijayram Gajapathi Raju college of Engineering in the stream of CSE.
                    I've played several roles in my college such as Class Representative ,Event Co-ordinator and Food-Incharge of our college canteen.
                    Coming to my participations, the one thing which is most important is my  participation in the ENTREPRENEUR CONTEST conducted by WeSchool,Bangalore wherein I published an idea of 
                    E-ZEROX machine.
                </p>

                    Actually everyone gets a turning point in their life, for me the turning point has come at my school life itself
                    where I am inspired by my Social Teacher (Ms. Rosy Dutta) who made me to believe that I can also compete with my peers.
                    I have a passion towards teaching a lot and so worked as a Teacher in NIIT VIZAG where I dealt with courses such as C and JAVA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am follower of myself--very weird thing no one will notice as I improve my thoughts based on my actions and the societal conditions.
                    I like to play games such as CHESS,CRICKET,TABLE TENNIS and BADMINTON. I also make use of android playstore a lot in installing applications much regarding to education.
                    My passion towards teaching lead me to have a<a href="krishnasairam1997.blogspot.in" target="_blank">blog </a>of my own.
